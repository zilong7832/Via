## 🌐 Publish and Embed Your Map

The app supports a public, read-only map backed by `public/footprints.json`:

* `/?public=1` opens the full public map.
* `/?embed=1` opens the compact version intended for an iframe.
* `/` keeps the original editable, browser-local experience.

To update the public map, export a backup from the editable app, replace
`public/footprints.json` with that file, and commit and push the change. The
public modes accept both the original array backup format and the newer
versioned `{ "version", "tags", "trips" }` format.
