## ✨ Key Features

* **🔒 Privacy First**: All data is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`). No data is ever sent to a server. Your memories belong to you.
* **🌏 Smart Views**: Automatically switches between **World**, **China**, and **USA** views. 
* **🏷️ Multi-Tag System**: Create and manage multiple tags (e.g., "Me", "Couple", "Family"). Toggle between them to see different sets of footprints.
* **💾 Backup & Restore**: Export your data as a JSON file. Share your footprints with friends or sync between devices by simply uploading the backup file.
* **⚡️ Instant Search**: Integrated global geocoding allows you to search for any city and fly there instantly.

## 🌐 Publish and Embed Your Map

The app supports a public, read-only map backed by `public/footprints.json`:

* `/?public=1` opens the full public map.
* `/?embed=1` opens the compact version intended for an iframe.
* `/` keeps the original editable, browser-local experience.

To update the public map, export a backup from the editable app, replace
`public/footprints.json` with that file, and commit and push the change. The
public modes accept both the original array backup format and the newer
versioned `{ "version", "tags", "trips" }` format.
